### Hi there 👋

I'm Yaroslav, a Senior Magento Developer focused on backend development and e-commerce architecture. I enjoy diving deep into complex technical challenges, building custom solutions, and making things work smoothly under the hood.

My work revolves around understanding how Magento really works - from database structures and EAV systems to API design and module architecture. I believe good backend code should be clean, scalable, and easy for other developers to work with.

#### 🛠 What I Work With

**Core Technologies**
- PHP 8+ & Magento 2 architecture
- MySQL database design and optimization
- Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for search solutions
- REST & GraphQL API development

**Development & Integration**
- Custom module development from scratch
- Payment gateway integrations
- Third-party service connections
- Data migration and transformation

**Infrastructure & Performance**
- Docker for development environments
- Nginx, Varnish, Redis configuration
- Linux server administration
- Database indexing and query optimization
- Debugging and troubleshooting

#### 💡 What I Enjoy

Building things that solve real problems - whether it's a custom payment integration for Ukrainian market, optimizing slow database queries, or figuring out why something broke in production at 3 AM. I like when code is elegant and when complex systems just work.

I'm always exploring new approaches, learning from the community, and occasionally contributing back to open-source projects.
